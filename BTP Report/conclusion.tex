\section{conclusion}
This work mainly focus on attacks possible in cloud computing and what are mitigations to these attacks.
This work also proposes simulation model suitable for the detection of DDoS attacks. The obtained simulation results demonstrates the effective dangerousness of the amplification attacks that permit to a single host to generate an huge volume of traffic by exploiting infected hosts (botnet) and vulnerable servers. The developed model constitutes a valuable tool for easing the study of the effects of such types of attacks.

\section{Scope of further work}
(1) DDOS attacks are launched using well coordinated and highly organized attack network. the ISPs are also required to work in tandem for designing technical and economic models to achieve cooperation, in order to fight against the menace of Ddos attacks collaboratively.

(2) we have to develop a model to prevent DDOS attack using Nessi2.
